An attempt at the Eno/Lanois pitch shift + reverb feedback loop effect.
The most important parameters are on page 1.
Uses a simple rotary head style pitch shift / delay and the freeverb~ external

Parameters
p1:
Shift Mode - 5 modes with different pitch shifts, also some have reversed playback direction
Rev Size - Size of reverb, also affects feedback
Feedback - Amount of pitch shift fed into the reverb
Dry/Wet  - Total dry/wet balance
p2:
P. In/Rev - Balance of dry input signal and reverb signal to feed into the pitch shift 
            At 0 (all dry) there will be no feeback, and at 1 (all reverb) there is no input
P. LPF   - Frequency of low pass filterig right before the pitch shifter input
p3:
Rev Dry/Wet - Amount of dry input vs pitch shift fed into the reverb
Rev Damp - Damping of the reverb algorithm
Rev Prefilt - Frequency of low pass filtering right before the reverb input
