MIDI note generator
First two pages control when notes are triggered (from an internal clock , the midi clock, or by incoming note on). 
Next two control ranges of the octave, velocity and length of generated notes.
Last three pages control the relative probability of each note in the octave.
Each note C-B has a probablity parameter. 
At 0 the note will never sound, so only the RATIO of probabilites matters 
(ie if all notes are 0.01 will produce the same result as all notes being 0.99).
Controls values are squared for each probability ie 50 is 25%, 10 is 1%.

Speed -  when over 10ms, note could be generated every N ms
MidiClk Div - Subidivisios of the midi clock  0 (off), 1 = quarter note, 2 = eighth, 3 = triplets, 4 = 16th notes ......24
Midi Trigger - Note could be triggered at incoming midi note on
Probability - Chance of a note being generated at each trigger

Page: Trigger 2
Poly Trigger - From 1-8 notes can  be generated on each trigger 9depending on probability
Midi Thru - Incoming midi stream can be passed through or turned off
