Sampletwig

Based on Samplenest https://patchstorage.com/samplenest/
Can load one sample only, but now can be pitched via midi input

IMPORTANT:
All samples are stored in /Media/samples/ starting at the base of your USB drive.
You must create this folder before running the patch.
Iâ€™ve also uploaded an archive with some to get you started (mainly field recordings and other organelle patches) here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJh8TJ1MR_qKNBu9thjmaoJhCkQ9HUr-/view?usp=sharing
This patch will find files in that folder ending in .wav (case sensitive!).

Controls:
Main:
  Sample Select - Displays 0-100, but sample name is printed to bottom of screen
  Volume
  Pan
Pitch: 
  Semitone
  Fine Tune
  Mod Rate
  Mod Depth
Loop:
  Mode - Chooses between 6 looping modes (modes are printed to the bottom of the screen)
         gate
         oneshot 
         loop 
         pingpong
         randpp - random ping pong, read pointer will reverse direction at a random point in the loop
         randcut - plays random sections of the loop, Env control adjusts envelop at each cut point
  Start - Sample start point
  End   - Sample end point (if less than start value playback is reversed)
  Env   - adds attack and decay, if 0 samples may click

Misc:
  Hold: Note Hold (see note on Aux below)
  Pitch Filt: Amount filtering on pitch (portamento), lower = slower
  
Aux: if 'Hold' knob is 0, turns hold on or off. I 'Hold' knob is 1, releases current notes but leaves hold on.
